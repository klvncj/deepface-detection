**Face Recognition and Analysis with DeepFace**

This project captures real-time images from your webcam, detects faces, and performs facial analysis (age, gender, emotion, race) using the DeepFace library.


---
**Features**

	•	Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
	•	Face analysis (age, gender, emotion, race) using DeepFace.
	•	Captures and saves images with unique filenames.

**Setup**

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:
	•	Python 3.7 or later
	•	pip

Install Required Libraries

Run the following command to install all dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt  

Add this to requirements.txt:

opencv-python  
deepface  
tensorflow  
tf-keras  

**Controls**

	•	Press ‘k’: Captures an image, saves it, and performs facial analysis.
	•	Press ‘q’: Exits the application.

**Acknowledgements**

	•	OpenCV for face detection.
	•	DeepFace for facial analysis.
